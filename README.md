## Rough Draft - Needs Fixing

1. Add logo to the top of header
2. Jumbotron rounded picture does not look great on mobile
3. Need to add progress bar for campaign 
4. Buttons in header do not look great in mobile

5. Navbar, need to vertically align the hrefs (looks bad in mobile)

6. About section - looks fine
  - Need to add grafitti and (x3) background
  
7. Teams (cards could use some polishing)


8. Thank you Donors - Need to complete this section, haven't started

9. Matchers- looks fine (need to vertically center card)
  -Possible scroll back up button
  
<del>10. Footer - looks great (change color of upper button to same as navbar).</del>
